Led one-on-one and small group tutorials for undergraduate math students, focusing on computational projects and statistical physics. Also delivered graduate-level guest lectures on ocean circulation, unsupervised classification, and ocean data in the Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Risk PhD programme.

### Guest Lecturer: Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Risk (2020 - 2022)

As a **Guest Lecturer** in the **Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Risk** (AI4ER) course at the **University of Cambridge**, I delivered graduate-level lectures focused on the intersection of **ocean circulation**, **unsupervised classification**, and **ocean data**.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Delivered graduate lectures on topics such as **ocean circulation**, **unsupervised classification**, and the application of **artificial intelligence** in environmental risk analysis
- Developed lecture content to ensure students understood complex environmental data analysis techniques
- Guided discussions on how **AI and machine learning** can be used to tackle challenges in environmental sciences

### Impact:
My involvement in this course allowed me to share my expertise in **data science** and **AI** within the context of environmental risk. I helped students gain an understanding of how **AI models** can be applied to real-world problems in environmental science and decision-making.

### Supervisor (2021 - Present)

I have had the privilege of supervising **PhD students** and **researchers** at **Cambridge**, working on projects involving **machine learning** and **adjoint modeling** to tackle complex **environmental** and **oceanographic** challenges. 

### Key Supervision Experience:
- **Simon Thomas** (PhD student): Supervising research on using **machine learning** to quantify **storm surge risk**.
- **Rachel Furner** (PhD student): Co-supervising a project on **data-driven ocean models** using **machine learning** techniques.
- **Ciara Pimm** (PhD student, U. Liverpool): Co-supervising research on **adjoint modeling** applications in the **Southern Ocean**.

### Impact:
Through these supervisory roles, I have mentored students in developing cutting-edge research and contributed to the advancement of knowledge in the fields of **oceanography**, **machine learning**, and **environmental risk assessment**.
