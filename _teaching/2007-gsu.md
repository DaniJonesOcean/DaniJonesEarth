Taught undergraduate courses in environmental physics, solar system astronomy, and stellar/galactic astronomy while integrating research-backed active teaching methods.

### Overview

At **Georgia Southern University**, I designed and taught several undergraduate courses in **physics** and **astronomy**. These courses covered a broad range of topics, including **environmental physics**, **solar system astronomy**, **stellar and galactic astronomy**, and **physics**. I also designed and led **practical laboratory sessions** and **observatory sessions** for students, providing them with hands-on experience to complement their theoretical learning.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Designed and taught undergraduate courses in **environmental physics**, **solar system astronomy**, and **stellar/galactic astronomy**
- Led **practical laboratory and observatory sessions**, where students conducted experiments and made astronomical observations
- Applied **active teaching methods**, including **studio physics**, to engage students in problem-solving and critical thinking
- Graded assignments, provided **feedback**, and assessed student progress

### Impact:
This experience allowed me to actively engage students with a range of physical science concepts and helped them build a strong foundational understanding of the physical universe. My use of **active learning strategies** facilitated student engagement and practical application of theoretical knowledge.
