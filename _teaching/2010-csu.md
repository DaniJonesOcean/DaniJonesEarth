Assisted in teaching a year-long graduate atmospheric dynamics course, providing guest lectures and detailed feedback on homework assignments.

### Overview

At **Colorado State University**, I served as a **Teaching Assistant** for a year-long graduate course in **atmospheric dynamics**. I assisted in the delivery of lectures, supported students in understanding complex physical concepts, and contributed to the course's development. I also gave guest lectures on specific topics such as **phase speed** and **group velocity** and provided in-depth **feedback** on homework problem sets.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Assisted in the delivery of **graduate-level atmospheric dynamics** lectures
- Gave **guest lectures** on specialized topics in atmospheric science (e.g., **phase speed** and **group velocity**)
- Graded and provided **detailed feedback** on homework problem sets
- Held **office hours** to support students in understanding challenging material

### Impact:
This role strengthened my ability to communicate complex atmospheric concepts to graduate students while providing valuable feedback to help them improve their understanding. I gained experience in teaching high-level material and furthered my passion for educating the next generation of scientists.
