Supervised and mentored undergraduate and gradue students and postdocs across diverse research projects, guiding them in developing advanced analytical skills and fostering their academic and professional growth.

### Supervision of Undergraduate, Graduate, and Postdoctoral Students

I have had the privilege of supervising students at various levels, from **undergraduate** to **postdoctoral** researchers, across multiple institutions. My supervisory experience spans a broad range of topics, from **machine learning** and **oceanography** to **environmental risk analysis** and **adjoint modeling**.

### Key Supervision Experience:

- **Undergraduate Supervision**:
  - **Georgia Southern University**: Supervised students in **oceanography**, **physics**, and **mathematics**. I guided students in the application of **computational techniques** for environmental science research, fostering their understanding of **physical oceanography** and **data analysis**.

- **Graduate Supervision**:
  - **University of Cambridge**: Supervised graduate students working on **data-driven ocean models** and **adjoint modeling**. Focused on research applications in **climate science**, **Southern Ocean dynamics**, and the **North Atlantic carbon sink**. Provided guidance on research methodology, **machine learning**, and **scientific writing**.
  - **University of Liverpool**: Co-supervised a **PhD student** applying **adjoint modeling** techniques to study the **Southern Ocean** and its role in **global carbon cycling**.
  
- **Postdoctoral Supervision**:
  - **British Antarctic Survey (BAS)**: Supervised **postdoctoral researchers** working on projects related to **environmental sensors**, **artificial intelligence**, and **Southern Ocean heat content**. Mentored them in both **theoretical** and **applied research**, including **AI-driven climate models** and ocean dynamics.
  - **University of Cambridge**: Mentored **postdoctoral researchers** studying **North Atlantic variability**, with a focus on **interannual variability** and **machine learning** approaches.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Providing ongoing **mentorship** and **guidance** on research projects, ensuring students and postdocs stay focused on the scientific questions at hand.
- Reviewing and providing feedback on **research proposals**, **papers**, and **theses**, helping to shape students' academic careers.
- Developing and overseeing the execution of **research plans**, ensuring appropriate use of **scientific methods** and **data analysis techniques**.
- Assisting students with their professional development, including opportunities for **conference presentations** and **publication writing**.
  
### Impact:
Through my supervision, I have helped shape the careers of many researchers and fostered a collaborative environment focused on cutting-edge research. My role in developing the next generation of scientists and researchers has been deeply fulfilling, and I am proud to have contributed to their academic and professional growth.
