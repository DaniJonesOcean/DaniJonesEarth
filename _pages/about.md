## About Dr. Dani Jones

I am what you might call an "Earth system scientist" with a strong foundation in physical oceanography, applied mathematics, and numerical modeling. Currently, I work as an Associate Research Scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), where I lead efforts at the intersection of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and environmental modeling. My research is focused on using computational methods to understand and address critical environmental challenges, particularly those driven by climate change. 

At CIGLR, I am establishing the **Great Lakes Artificial Intelligence Laboratory**, a hub for applying ML/AI and modeling techniques to Great Lakes research and restoration. Our work spans a range of applications, including observing system design and water level forecasting.

With a background in **physical oceanography** and expertise in **adjoint modeling** and **unsupervised classification**, I specialize in using data-driven and modeling approaches to gain insights into complex Earth system processes. My research has a particular focus on large-scale ocean circulation and dynamics, with previous work in the **Southern Ocean** and **North Atlantic Ocean**. I have also worked extensively with **Argo float profiles** and have applied mathematical techniques to better understand global ocean dynamics.

As a researcher, I am driven by a desire to make a tangible difference in the world. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, I aim to develop solutions that can help society adapt to the impacts of climate change, especially in vulnerable coastal areas. I am deeply committed to interdisciplinary collaboration, drawing on the expertise of my colleagues and partners from around the world to tackle complex problems.

**My Expertise Includes:**
- Environmental data science & machine learning for Earth system analysis
- Large-scale ocean circulation & dynamics
- Numerical modeling (adjoint, forward)
- Unsupervised classification of environmental data (e.g., Argo float profiles)
- Observing system design for climate & environmental monitoring
- Climate adaptation strategies, especially for coastal and freshwater ecosystems

In addition to my research, I am actively involved in several professional organizations, including my role as **Co-chair of the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) Working Group on Observing System Design**, where I help guide the future of global ocean observation systems.

I'm passionate about **collaborative problem-solving** and fostering an inclusive research environment. I believe that the best science happens when diverse perspectives come together to generate creative solutions for a sustainable future.

I am always open to new collaborations, so please get in touch if you would like to discuss opportunities.
