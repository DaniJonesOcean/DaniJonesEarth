**Exploring how to create safer seagoing work environments for transgender and gender diverse scientists.**

**Abstract:**

Fieldwork, including work done at sea, is a key component of many geoscientists' careers. Recent studies have highlighted the pervasive harassment faced by women and LGBTQ+ people during fieldwork. However, transgender and gender diverse (TGD) scientists face obstacles that have not yet been thoroughly examined. We fill this gap by sharing our experiences as TGD people. Collectively, we have experienced sexual harassment, misconduct, privacy issues, and legal and medical struggles while conducting seagoing work. Here, we provide recommendations for individuals, cruise leaders, and institutions for making seagoing work safer for our communities. We also discuss recent efforts towards implementing these recommendations.
