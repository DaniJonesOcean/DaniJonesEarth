### Overview
The **C-STREAMS** project focuses on understanding the physical controls on the **North Atlantic carbon sink**. By examining how upstream factors such as **wind stress** and **buoyancy forcing** influence nutrient and carbon transport via the **Gulf Stream**, this research aims to better understand the mechanisms that drive the carbon cycle in the North Atlantic.

Collaborators include **Ric Williams** from the University of Liverpool, with support from the **British Antarctic Survey** and the **University of Miami**. Together, we aim to uncover how physical processes in the ocean impact the long-term storage and sequestration of carbon in the North Atlantic.

### Key Objectives:
- Examine the role of **wind stress** and **buoyancy forcing** on ocean circulation and carbon transport
- Investigate the pathways through which nutrients and carbon are transported from the Gulf Stream to the North Atlantic
- Understand the implications of these physical processes for the overall carbon sink strength and climate models
- Collaborate with oceanographic institutions to enhance the global understanding of oceanic carbon cycling

### My Role:
As a key collaborator in this project, my role involves developing numerical models to simulate and analyze the impacts of physical controls on nutrient and carbon transport in the Gulf Stream and beyond. I apply advanced techniques in **ocean circulation modeling** and **adjoint methods** to quantify the sensitivity of the North Atlantic carbon sink to changes in upstream forcing.

### Impact:
The findings of this project will improve our understanding of the **North Atlantic carbon sink**, which plays a critical role in regulating global climate. By identifying the physical mechanisms controlling the carbon cycle in this region, we hope to inform future climate models and support more effective climate change mitigation strategies.

### Future Directions:
Future work will extend this research to examine how changing climate conditions—such as shifts in wind patterns and buoyancy forcing—could alter the strength of the North Atlantic carbon sink and its role in global carbon cycling.
