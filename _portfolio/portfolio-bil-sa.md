### Overview
The **GLERL BIL-SA Project** is an ongoing collaboration aimed at improving water level forecasting tools used by the **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)** and **Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)**. This project focuses on advancing the precision of predictions for the Great Lakes' water levels, which is essential for flood management, infrastructure protection, and environmental sustainability in the region.

### Key Objectives:
- Enhance predictive models for water level forecasting
- Support decision-making related to flood management and infrastructure protection
- Integrate climate change data into predictive tools for long-term planning
- Apply advanced machine learning and AI techniques to improve model accuracy

### My Role:
As part of the team, I lead the integration of machine learning approaches to refine existing forecasting models and help build tools for more accurate and timely water level predictions.

### Impact:
This project aims to deliver practical solutions that directly inform policy and operational decisions, helping to safeguard communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure in the Great Lakes basin.
